# MS-Thesis

My Master's thesis project delved into the intriguing realm of Dynamical Systems through an exploration of the "Game of Ducci Sequences." Within this study, I investigated the intricate dynamical properties of the Ducci map by employing a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from the realms of Linear Algebra, Number Theory, and Dynamical Systems theory. <br/>
Dynamical Systems, in essence, deals with the study of how systems evolve over time, often exhibiting complex behaviors governed by underlying mathematical principles. 
<br />In the context of my thesis, I delved into understanding how the Ducci map evolves iteratively, revealing patterns and behaviors that intertwine with fundamental mathematical concepts. Through this interdisciplinary investigation, I aimed to unravel the underlying dynamics of the Ducci sequences, shedding light on their behavior and properties within the framework of Dynamical Systems theory.
## Introduction
Ducci sequences, named after Enrico Ducci, are mathematical constructs that involve iteratively manipulating a sequence of integers. The process begins with an initial sequence of 
n integers, where each subsequent sequence is generated by taking the absolute difference between consecutive elements. This difference operation is applied cyclically, meaning the last element's difference is taken with the first element to form the next sequence. The process continues until a repetitive cycle or a constant sequence is reached.

For example, starting with the sequence ``` math (a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}) ``` the next sequence is formed by computing the absolute differences:
