# MS-Thesis

My Master's thesis project delved into the intriguing realm of Dynamical Systems through an exploration of the "Game of Ducci Sequences." Within this study, I investigated the intricate dynamical properties of the Ducci map by employing a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from the realms of Linear Algebra, Number Theory, and Dynamical Systems theory. <br/>
Dynamical Systems, in essence, deals with the study of how systems evolve over time, often exhibiting complex behaviors governed by underlying mathematical principles. 
<br />In the context of my thesis, I delved into understanding how the Ducci map evolves iteratively, revealing patterns and behaviors that intertwine with fundamental mathematical concepts. Through this interdisciplinary investigation, I aimed to unravel the underlying dynamics of the Ducci sequences, shedding light on their behavior and properties within the framework of Dynamical Systems theory.
